# Kitty Cam

This is a hobby project I chose to pursue in order to familiarize myself with my new Raspberry Pi. The Kitty Cam is powered by a Raspberry Pi Node.js app and uses a camera and PIR motion sensor.  

This repo houses the front end of the app and uses PubNub to provide live image updates when the script is running. For the actual RaspberryPi camera app, please visit [here](https://github.com/meeshyd/KittyCam).

Many thanks to [GirlieMac](https://github.com/girliemac/RPi-KittyCam) for the awesome idea and tutorial!
